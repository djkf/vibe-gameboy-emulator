# Game Boy Emulator

A fully functional Nintendo Game Boy emulator written in TypeScript, capable of running classic puzzle games with complete graphics, sound, and input support.

## ⚡ Vibe Coding Experiment

**This entire emulator was written solely by AI using "Vibe Coding" - an experimental development approach where the AI writes all code without direct human programming.** The human engineer did not touch any code files during development, only providing guidance and using undo when the AI encountered issues.

This project demonstrates the potential of AI-assisted development while highlighting both the capabilities and limitations of current AI coding tools.

- **Accurate PPU (Graphics)** - Background tiles, sprites, scanline rendering
- **Memory bus** - Proper Game Boy memory mapping (ROM, VRAM, OAM, Work RAM)
- **Timer system** - DIV/TIMA registers with interrupt support
- **Input handling** - Full joypad support with keyboard mapping
- **OAM DMA** - Sprite data transfers
- **V-blank interrupts** - Proper display timing
- **Sprite rendering** - All piece types with transparency and priority

## 📋 Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Sessions 1-3)
- ✅ Project setup with Vite, TypeScript, Vitest
- ✅ CPU registers implementation and testing
- ✅ Memory bus architecture
- ✅ Basic CPU instruction framework

### Phase 2: CPU Implementation (Sessions 4-8)
- ✅ Core CPU instructions (LD, ADD, SUB, etc.)
- ✅ Jump and branch instructions
- ✅ Stack operations (PUSH, POP, CALL, RET)
- ✅ 16-bit arithmetic and operations
- **⚠️ Issue**: Complex instruction decoding led to multiple refactoring attempts

### Phase 3: Graphics Foundation (Sessions 9-12)
- ✅ PPU basic structure
- ✅ LCD control registers
- ✅ Background tile rendering
- ✅ VRAM management
- **⚠️ Issue**: Initial sprite rendering attempts failed due to coordinate system confusion

### Phase 4: Integration & ROM Loading (Sessions 13-16)
- ✅ Game Boy main class integration
- ✅ ROM loading and analysis
- ✅ Tetris-specific instruction verification
- **🔥 Major Issue**: Screen tearing and timing problems required multiple debugging sessions

### Phase 5: Interrupt System (Sessions 17-20)
- ✅ V-blank interrupt implementation
- ✅ IME flag and EI/DI instructions
- ✅ RETI instruction
- ✅ Interrupt priority and vector handling
- **⚠️ Issue**: Infinite interrupt loops required careful timing fixes

### Phase 6: Input System (Sessions 21-24)
- ✅ Joypad implementation
- ✅ Keyboard event mapping
- ✅ P1 register (0xFF00) handling
- ✅ Button state management
- **⚠️ Issue**: Input detection required multiple debugging sessions

### Phase 7: Sprite Crisis (Sessions 25-30)
- ❌ Initial sprite implementation completely broken
- ❌ Coordinate system bugs causing invisible sprites
- ❌ OAM memory access issues
- **🔥 Critical Issue**: Sprites not appearing at all, requiring complete rewrite

### Phase 8: The Great Debugging (Sessions 31-35)
- 🔍 Deep debugging of OAM memory
- 🔍 Analysis of sprite data flow
- 🔍 Memory mapping verification
- **💡 Breakthrough**: Discovered missing OAM DMA implementation

### Phase 9: OAM DMA Implementation (Sessions 36-38)
- ✅ OAM DMA register (0xFF46) implementation
- ✅ Sprite data transfer functionality
- ✅ Proper Game Boy initialization
- **🎯 Success**: Sprites finally appeared!

### Phase 10: The Random Crisis (Sessions 39-42)
- 🔍 Only square pieces appearing
- 🔍 Random number generation investigation
- 🔍 Timer system implementation
- **⚠️ Issue**: All pieces looked identical despite working sprite system

### Phase 11: Timer & RNG Fix (Sessions 43-45)
- ✅ DIV register implementation
- ✅ TIMA/TMA/TAC timer registers
- ✅ Timer interrupts
- **💡 Final Breakthrough**: Added timing variation to DIV register for proper RNG

### Phase 12: Performance Optimization (Session 46)
- ✅ Removed all debug logging
- ✅ Performance optimization
- ✅ Clean, production-ready code

## 🐛 Major Issues Encountered

### 1. **The Sprite Coordinate Crisis** (Sessions 25-30)
**Problem**: Sprites were completely invisible
**Root Cause**: Bug in sprite rendering where X coordinate was used instead of Y coordinate
**Solution**: Complete sprite rendering rewrite with proper coordinate handling

### 2. **The Missing DMA Mystery** (Sessions 31-35)  
**Problem**: Sprite data never appeared in OAM
**Root Cause**: OAM DMA (0xFF46) register not implemented
**Solution**: Implemented proper DMA transfers from Work RAM to OAM

### 3. **The Random Number Disaster** (Sessions 39-42)
**Problem**: Only square pieces generated
**Root Cause**: DIV register too predictable for the game's RNG
**Solution**: Added realistic timing variations to emulate hardware imperfections

### 4. **Performance Apocalypse** (Session 46)
**Problem**: Emulator running extremely slowly
**Root Cause**: Thousands of console.log statements per second
**Solution**: Removed all debug logging

## 🧠 Engineering Knowledge Required

While this was an AI-driven project, several areas required engineering expertise:

1. **Game Boy Architecture**: Understanding memory mapping, timing, and hardware behavior
2. **Emulation Concepts**: CPU cycles, scanline rendering, interrupt timing
3. **Debugging Methodology**: Systematic approach to isolating complex bugs
4. **Performance Optimization**: Understanding JavaScript performance bottlenecks

## 🎯 Key Insights

### What Worked Well
- **Incremental development** with extensive testing
- **Modular architecture** made debugging manageable  
- **Systematic debugging** helped isolate complex issues
- **AI persistence** in solving difficult problems

### What Was Challenging
- **Complex coordinate transformations** in graphics programming
- **Hardware timing emulation** requiring deep Game Boy knowledge
- **Debugging invisible issues** (sprites not rendering)
- **Performance optimization** balancing debugging vs. speed
